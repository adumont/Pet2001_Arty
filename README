A Commodore PET in an Artix-7 FPGA.

This is the source code for a Xilinx Vivado project targeting a Digilent
Arty FPGA evaluation board.

After cloning this repository, start Vivado and go to the TCL console and
type "cd <path-to-repository>" to move to the top directory of the repository.
Then type "source project.tcl".  Vivado will create a project within the
repository under the directory "project_1".

At this point, you should be able to generate the bitstream by clicking
"Generate Bitstream" under the "Program and Debug" in the Project Manager.
If your Arty is plugged in properly, you should be able to use the Hardware
Manager to open the target and then program the device with the bitstream.
The first time you program the device, you'll be prompted for the bitstream
file location (XXX I'm not sure why it doesn't automatically know where it
is).  Look for the bitstream in:
 <path-of-repository>/project_1/Pet2001_Arty.runs/impl_1/Pet2001_Arty.bit

After the first time programming the device, the Hardware Manager will
default to this file.

Let me know if you have any trouble.
