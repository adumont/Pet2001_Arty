A Commodore PET in an Artix-7 FPGA.

This is the source code for a Xilinx Vivado project targeting a Digilent
Arty FPGA evaluation board.

After cloning this repository, start Vivado and go to the TCL console and
type "cd <path-to-repository>" to move to the top directory of this repository.
Then type "source project.tcl".  Vivado will create a project within the
repository under the directory "Pet2001_Arty".  The project source code
will remain outside the project in the "src" directory so it can be under
source control.

Alternatively, you can create the project from a shell prompt by typing
"make project".

At this point, you should be able to generate the bitstream from within
Vivado by clicking "Generate Bitstream" under the "Program and Debug" in
the Project Manager.  You can also generate the bitstream from a shell
prompt by with "make bitstream".

Once the bitstream is generated, you should be able to use the Hardware
Manager to open the target and program the device with the bitstream.
The first time you program the device, you will be prompted for the bitstream
file location (XXX I'm not sure why it doesn't automatically know where it
is).  Look for the bitstream in:
 <path-of-repository>/Pet2001_Arty/Pet2001_Arty.runs/impl_1/Pet2001_Arty.bit
After the first time programming the device, the Hardware Manager will
remember this file location.

Alternatively, you can program the Arty from a shell by typing "make program".

Let me know if you have any trouble.
