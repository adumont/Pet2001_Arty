A Commodore PET in an Artix-7 FPGA.

This is the source code for a Xilinx Vivado project targeting a Digilent
Arty FPGA evaluation board.

After cloning this repository, start Vivado and go to the TCL console and
type "cd <path-to-repository>" to move to the top directory of this repository.
Then type "source project.tcl".  Vivado will create a project within the
repository under the directory "Pet2001_Arty".  The project source code
will remain outside the project in the "src" directory so it can be under
source control.

At this point, you should be able to generate the bitstream from within
Vivado by clicking "Generate Bitstream" under the "Program and Debug" section
of the Project Manager.

Once the bitstream is generated, you should be able to use the Hardware
Manager to open the target and program the device with the bitstream.
The first time you program the device, you might be prompted for the bitstream
file location (XXX I'm not sure why it doesn't automatically know where it
is).  Look for the bitstream in:
 <path-of-repository>/Pet2001_Arty/Pet2001_Arty.runs/impl_1/Pet2001_Arty.bit
After the first time programming the device, the Hardware Manager will
remember this file location.

Let me know if you have any trouble.

A second tcl script called "project2.tcl" generates a project called 
Pet2001Real_Arty which is a design that can interface to a real Commodore PET's
video and keyboard (in other words replacing the PET motherboard with
an FPGA).  I haven't documented this project yet.  It requires some hardware
to convert outputs to drive 5V TTL video signals.
